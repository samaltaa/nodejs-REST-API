# Node.js RESTful API with Express and MongoDB

This repository contains a simple example of building a RESTful API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API allows you to manage and manipulate data through various HTTP endpoints.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
- MongoDB: Install and set up a MongoDB instance. You can download it from [mongodb.com](https://www.mongodb.com/).

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/samaltaa/testapi.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd test-api
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Server

To start the API server, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be running at `http://localhost:3000` by default. You can change the port in the configuration (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

### API Endpoints

The API provides the following endpoints for managing resources:

- `GET /api/resource`: Retrieve a list of resources.
- `GET /api/resource/:id`: Retrieve a specific resource by its ID.
- `POST /api/resource`: Create a new resource.
- `PUT /api/resource/:id`: Update a resource by its ID.
- `DELETE /api/resource/:id`: Delete a resource by its ID.

Replace `resource` with the appropriate resource name in the endpoint URLs.

## Configuration

You can configure the API by editing the `config.js` file. Here, you can specify the MongoDB connection settings, server port, and other options.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  mongoURI: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/your-database',
  port: 3000,
  // Other configuration options...
};
```

## Dependencies

This project utilizes the following main dependencies:

- Express: Web application framework for handling HTTP requests and routes.
- MongoDB: Official MongoDB driver for Node.js to interact with the MongoDB database.
- Body-parser: Middleware for parsing incoming request bodies.
- Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js.

These dependencies are listed in the `package.json` file and are installed automatically when you run `npm install`.
